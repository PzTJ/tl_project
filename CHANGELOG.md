(hopefully) upcoming features:
- better mobile support
- better chapter navigation
- character expressions (I don't think I can do this one but I'll just put it here)
- better website deployment
- considering changing all instances of "monster" to "Kaibutsu"?<br>(I know Kaibutsu's the official term, but...)

note to self:
- PROOFREAD WORLD END TRAVELERS
- check again if Gaisei's pronouns to himself is used consistently
